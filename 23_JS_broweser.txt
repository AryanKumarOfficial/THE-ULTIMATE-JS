Javascript was initially created to make webpages alive. JS can be written in a web page's HTML to make it interactive.

The browser has an embedded engine called JS engine or JS runtime.

Javascript's ability in the browser is very limited to protect the user's safety. For example, a webpage on https://google.com cannot access https://facebook.com and steal information from there.
